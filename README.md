# Estimating-benefits-of-MPA-networks-for-reef-sharks
This repository contains all the code for analysing the movements of individuals of three shark species tagged with passive acoustic monitors, and the code to simulate their movement in a marine protected area network. The scripts are organised as follows:

1. Analysis of species' movements to estimate model parameters:
* Parameters of the gamma distribution to control travelling distances
* Parameters controling the probability of travelling to another reef in the system, going out of the reef network system or returning to the reef network.
* Parameters for natural death rate and fishing rates
2. Model of shark movement among protected and unprotected reefs
3. Simulation scripts of the model
4. Data (passive acoustic telemetry)
